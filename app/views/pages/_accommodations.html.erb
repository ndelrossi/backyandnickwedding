    <p>We have reserved a block of rooms for the weekend at the Boston Marriott Burlington, which is a twenty minute drive from the Codman Estate. The hotel has given us a discounted rate of $169 per night. Rooms are available for Friday/Saturday night. The hotel requires a two night minimum stay for this deal.  To reserve a room in our hotel block please call the number below and mention the Champlin/DelRossi wedding. The deadline to reserve a room at the discounted rate is September 16, 2015.</p>
    <p>More info to come on rooms at the Colonial Inn.</p>
    <p><strong>Please be advised: </strong>All guests planning to stay in hotels should book as early as they can. Our wedding is on the same weekend as The Head Of The Charles Regatta which attracts more than 400,000 spectators. Hotels in the area have advised us that they often sell out during this weekend.</p>
