bride:
  name: Becky Champlin
  img: becky.jpg
  email: beckychamplin82@gmail.com
  phone: (401) 219-9067
  bio: |
    <p>Becky grew up in Coventry, RI, where she had a perfectly healthy
    interest in true crime and serial killers. (No one was concerned
    about this.) Becky dreamed of living overseas in the developing
    world to help others and learn about the world.</p>

    <p>Becky went off to study Criminology at the University of
    Maryland but quickly realized that she did not actually want to
    work for the FBI as she previously thought. Majors were changed
    many times and Becky eventually transferred to the University of
    Rhode Island where she graduated with a degree in Psychology.</p>

    <p>Two weeks after graduation Becky joined the Peace Corps and
    moved to Tanzania. Becky lived in a small village near Njombe town
    in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. Becky spoke Swahili and worked
    on several agriculture projects, including her biggest project, fish
    ponds for the village.</p>

    <p>After Peace Corps Becky moved back to Rhode Island and eventually
    made her way into Product and Project Management. In April 2012 Becky
    started her first job in Boston and a move to Boston soon followed.
    Currently Becky works in Project Management for a startup in downtown
    Boston and loves it. Becky has been vegan for eight years and has
    completed 16 half marathons and 2 full marathons. She loves cats,
    chocolate and tv shows about parasitic infections.</p>

groom:
  name: Nick DelRossi
  img: nick.jpg
  email: nickwtf@gmail.com
  phone: (774) 239-7121
  bio: |
    <p>Nick grew up in Burlington, MA, a suburb north of Boston. As a child he
    was into sports, medieval history, and video games and during high
    school became very interested in computers and chess.</p>

    <p>In 2000 Nick moved to Worcester, MA and attended college at
    Worcester State University. During college Nick became really interested
    in music and began playing guitar with friends. He has continued to play
    over the years and has built up a collection of guitars he doesn’t need.
    He is obsessed with musicians Paul Simon and Elliott Smith.</p>

    <p>It was in Worcester working at a local Papa Ginos where he would
    meet many of his closest friends. This convinced him to stay in Worcester
    for a number of years until he met Becky and decided to move with her to
    Somerville.</p>

    <p>Nick has worked at Xerox for the last several years in printing and
    desktop publishing. He has recently renewed an interest for software and
    web development and is planning a career transition in the future.</p>

    <p>Nick has very particular tastes for things which often confuses Becky
    into thinking that he’s a snob who hates everything. He loves movies,
    music, science, coffee, craft beer, and unlikely animal friends.</p>

relationship:
  title: Our Relationship
  bio: |
    <p>Nick and Becky met on the dating site OkCupid in January 2012. Their
    first date was at the English Cellar Alehouse on the East Side of
    Providence. Nick and Becky talked for four hours and things continued
    from there! For the first year of the relationship Nick was living in
    Worcester and Becky in Providence, so there was a lot of driving going
    on. Then Becky got a job in Boston and moved into a small apartment in
    Newton Highlands. The place in Newton let Nick and Becky practice living
    together and turns out it was great!</p>

    <p>In September 2013 Nick and Becky officially moved in together, to a
    place in Davis Square. Throughout the time living in Worcester,
    Providence, Newton and Somerville Nick and Becky discovered their love
    of traveling together and took many trips to NYC, DC, Chicago, San Diego
    and Costa Rica. In February 2015 Nick and Becky escaped the ten feet of
    snow in Boston and traveled to Oahu, Hawaii. On the first morning of the
    vacation Nick took Becky over to a beautiful spot at Magic Island and
    proposed.</p>

    <p>The couple share their apartment with an adorable Maine Coon named
    Pippa. The relationship works well as Nick tolerates the truly bizzarre
    tv shows that Becky loves, and Becky tolerates the video games that Nick
    loves. Nick and Becky share a love of Paul Simon, Seinfeld, Arcade Fire
    and eating really fast.</p>

      that Becky can’t keep track of. Taylor is a great Mom to the cutest
      Boston Terrier you will ever meet, Duncan. Taylor has completed several

      who has talked Becky out of many a meltdown and bad decision.  Laura
      graduated from Gibbs College in Boston and works in Creative Operations
      for CVS.  Laura loves pugs and is the Mom to a super cute black pug

  - name: Melissa DelRossi
    title: Bridesmaid
    img: melissadelrossi.jpg
    bio: |
      Melissa is the groom’s sister-in-law and basically the best
      sister-in-law that exists. She met her husband, Nick’s brother, at
      Westfield State College and then got her Doctorate in Physical
      Therapy at the University of Massachusetts. Becky cannot believe
      her luck that she has a Physical Therapist for a sister-in-law. In

      fixed several of Becky’s running injuries. Melissa is the Mom to the
      cutest kids in the entire world, Evan and Anna. Melissa is an
      accomplished marathoner and once beat Becky in a road race even though

    title: Best Man
    img: mikedelrossi.jpg
    bio: |
      Mike is the groom’s older brother. They have a strong relationship
      despite spending the first 15 years of their lives constantly engaged
      in brotherly fighting. Mike is married to bridesmaid Melissa and has
      two great kids named Evan and Anna. Before he had children Mike enjoyed
      cycling, snowboarding, and sleeping. Nick was the co best man at Mike’s
      wedding and might have said a few possibly derogatory remarks about Mike
      in his speech. Is revenge coming?

  - name: Mike Murray
    title: Groomsman<br>Justice of the Peace
    img: mikemurray.jpg
    bio: |
      Mike and the groom began their relationship as bitter enemies, arguing
      over which server tool groomsman Michael Brunell should use to connect
      to the computer game Counter-Strike. Eventually they were able to form a
      mutual respect for each other and became friends. Mike and the groom
      ended up living together in two locations in Worcester. He is dating
      bridesmaid Taylor and together they are parents to an unsightly
      dog-child named Duncan. Mike will also be marrying Becky and Nick.

  - name: Andy Parmenter
    title: Groomsman
    img: andyparmenter.jpg
    bio: |
      Andy and the groom met while working at Papa Ginos around 2001. Nick
      was tasked with the job of training Andy on how to make food. This was
      a disaster for the store because Nick did not care about training and
      Andy had no desire to learn. This mutual apathy for their jobs led to a
      strong friendship and also a financial loss for Papa Ginos. Andy and
      Nick share an interest in uplifting poetry, 90s computer games, and
      unsafe ocean conditions.

  - name: Brian Lauritsen
    title: Groomsman
    img: brianlauritsen.jpg
    bio: |
      Brian and the groom met as dorm neighbors at Worcester State College.
      They did not even realize they were neighbors for months and it wasn’t
      until social situations were forced on them that they had any
      interaction. However, soon after meeting they realized that they shared
      both a passion and a complete lack of talent for playing guitar. This
      resulted in a great friendship and a decade long attempt by both to
      become rock stars. They remain great friends today but unfortunately
      they still don’t have any talent for playing guitar.

  - name: Joe Carbeau
    title: Groomsman
    img: joecarbeau.jpg
    bio: |
      Joe grew up two houses down from the groom in Burlington, MA. They met
      when Nick was less than a year old and have been great friends ever
      since. Joe and the groom spent their teenage years playing basketball
      and eating big meals. Rumor has it Joe can still easily dunk a
      basketball. He is also a gentleman-scholar and a world-renowned expert
      on 1990s boy bands.

    bio_hidden: |
      Michael “Dickie" Brunell and the groom met while working at Papa Ginos
      in Worcester over a decade ago. Nick knew instantly after Dickie was
      hired that they would become great friends but convincing Dickie of that
      took weeks of negotiations. Eventually both sides were able to agree to
      the contract terms and the famous friendship deal pictured above was
      struck. The deal is set to expire a month before the wedding but
      hopefully both sides can agree on a contract extension.

  - name: Yavuz Kiremit
    title: Groomsman
    img: yavuzkiremit.jpg
    bio: |
      The groom met Yavuz through mutual friend and groomsman Michael Brunell.
      He loves fast cars and video games but dislikes chicken and water. Yavuz
      is a Turkish prince and has dominion over a great number of provinces in
      his home country. He will be wearing a traditional Turkic bashlyk during
      the wedding ceremony. Please pronounce his name correctly or he will get
      extremely angry.
