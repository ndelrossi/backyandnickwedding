bride:
  name: Becky Champlin

  email: beckychamplin82@gmail.com
  phone: (401) 219-9067
  bio: |
    <p>Becky grew up in Coventry, RI, where she had a perfectly healthy
    interest in true crime and serial killers. (No one was concerned
    about this.) Becky dreamed of living overseas in the developing
    world to help others and learn about the world.</p>

    <p>Becky went off to study Criminology at the University of
    Maryland but quickly realized that she did not actually want to
    work for the FBI as she previously thought. Majors were changed
    many times and Becky eventually transferred to the University of
    Rhode Island where she graduated with a degree in Psychology.</p>

    <p>Two weeks after graduation Becky joined the Peace Corps and
    moved to Tanzania. Becky lived in a small village near Njombe town
    in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. Becky spoke Swahili and worked
    on several agriculture projects, including her biggest project, fish
    ponds for the village.</p>

    <p>After Peace Corps Becky moved back to Rhode Island and eventually
    made her way into Product and Project Management. In April 2012 Becky
    started her first job in Boston and a move to Boston soon followed.
    Currently Becky works in Project Management for a startup in downtown
    Boston and loves it. Becky has been vegan for eight years and has
    completed 16 half marathons and 2 full marathons. She loves cats,
    chocolate and tv shows about parasitic infections.</p>

groom:
  name: Nick DelRossi

  email: nickwtf@gmail.com
  phone: (774) 239-7121
  bio: |
    <p>Nick grew up in Burlington, MA, a suburb north of Boston. As a child he
    was into sports, medieval history, and video games and during high
    school became very interested in computers and chess.</p>

    <p>In 2000 Nick moved to Worcester, MA and attended college at
    Worcester State University. During college Nick became really interested
    in music and began playing guitar with friends. He has continued to play
    over the years and has built up a collection of guitars he doesn’t need.
    He is obsessed with musicians Paul Simon and Elliott Smith.</p>

    <p>It was in Worcester working at a local Papa Ginos where where he would
    meet many of his closest friends. This convinced him to stay in Worcester
    for a number of years until he met Becky and decided to move with her to
    Somerville.</p>

    <p>Nick has worked at Xerox for the last several years in printing and
    desktop publishing. He has recently renewed an interest for software and
    web development and is planning a career transition in the future.</p>

    <p>Nick has very particular tastes for things which often confuses Becky
    into thinking that he’s a snob who hates everything. He loves movies,
    music, science, coffee, craft beer, and unlikely animal friends.</p>

relationship:
  title: Our Relationship
  bio: |
    <p>Nick and Becky met on the dating site OkCupid in January 2012. Their
    first date was at the English Cellar Alehouse on the East Side of
    Providence. Nick and Becky talked for four hours and things continued
    from there! For the first year of the relationship Nick was living in
    Worcester and Becky in Providence, so there was a lot of driving going
    on. Then Becky got a job in Boston and moved into a small apartment in
    Newton Highlands. The place in Newton let Nick and Becky practice living
    together and turns out it was great!</p>

    <p>In September 2013 Nick and Becky officially moved in together, to a
    place in Davis Square. Throughout the time living in Worcester,
    Providence, Newton and Somerville Nick and Becky discovered their love
    of traveling together and took many trips to NYC, DC, Chicago, San Diego
    and Costa Rica. In February 2015 Nick and Becky escaped the ten feet of
    snow in Boston and traveled to Oahu, Hawaii. On the first morning of the
    vacation Nick took Becky over to a beautiful spot at Magic Island and
    proposed.</p>

    <p>The couple share their apartment with an adorable Maine Coon named
    Pippa. The relationship works well as Nick tolerates the truly bizzarre
    tv shows that Becky loves, and Becky tolerates the video games that Nick
    loves. Nick and Becky share a love of Paul Simon, Seinfeld, Arcade Fire
    and eating really fast.</p>
